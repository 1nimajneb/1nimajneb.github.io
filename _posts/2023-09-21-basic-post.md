Project Proposal

CSPB 3112: Professional Development in Computer Science

Student: Ben Healy

Professor: Dr. David Knox

9/14/2023

Vision statement:

*   Finishing the Complete DevOps Ansible Automation Training course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-ansible-devops-automation-training/](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-ansible-devops-automation-training/)

will allow me to level up my skills at my new job. I am a DevSecOps Engineer and I just started my job three weeks ago. Studying Ansible Automation on my own time and in a low-stakes environment will help me advance my skills at my job and quickly while learning how to automate everyday tasks.

Motivation: Why is this project important to me?

*   This project is important is important to me because of the potential impact it will have on my new job. I think this course will greatly accelerate my advancement at my job.

Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives):

*   Learn to provision/deploy development/test/production servers
*   Build an Ansible server and deploy configuration to clients
*   Automate tedious tasks
*   Communicate with remote servers
*   Troubleshoot Ansible issues

Risks to project completion, including:

*   No prior experience working with Ansible.
*   Time constraints due to full time job and part time job.
*   Issues with virtual servers

Mitigation strategy for the risks listed above.

*   I am starting to learn Ansible at work
*   I dropped my second class to provide more time
*   I have access to specialists in this field

Project assessments – provide a list of evaluation criteria for the project

*   I will:
    *   Complete the course listed above.
    *   Create multiple virtual servers, install software on them, and patch that software.
    *   Creating these virtual servers as well as installing software and patching will be done using infrastructure as code.
    *   I will blog about my progress weekly.
